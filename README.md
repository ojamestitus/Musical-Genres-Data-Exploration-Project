## Introduction

Music plays a role in everyone’s life regardless of age, race, gender,
social class or any other defining characteristic. With the expansion of
the world wide web numerous online music streaming platforms have become
a popular source of listening to music. One such platform is Spotify.
Spotify first launched in 2008 and has grown to offer more than 60
million songs. Spotify contains songs from a variety of genres and keeps
track of the popularity of each track along with various other
characteristics of each track. As a group we were interested in studying
these characteristics to determine if there are unique characteristics
that make each genre unique, or if some of the characteristics are
shared across the genres. (Spotify, 2020)

We were able to find a nice set of data from TidyTuesday. The data was
shared in the Jan 21, 2020 TidyTuesday folder. The data was originally
obtained by making use of the spotifyr package.(Mock, 2020) The spotifyr
package was created by Charlie Thompson, Josiah Parry, Donal Phipps, and
Tom Wolff. The spotifyr package allows the bulk pulling of features
tracks from Spotify’s Web API. Since we are novices at using new
packages, we decided just using the data collected by TidyTuesday using
spotifyr would be sufficient for our study. We do recognize the fact
that there is a potential bias to the data we are analyzing because we
are not aware of the search parameters used by TidyTuesday when
collecting this data using spotifyr.(R Wrapper for the ‘Spotify’ Web
API, n.d.)

## Data Description

The genres that data was collected on include rock, R\&B, rap, EDM,
Latin, and pop. Each of these genre’s likely illicit thoughts about
certain characteristics. For example, rock and EDM I then to think of
loud, whereas R\&B I tend to think is softer. Rap is often thought to be
almost spoken whereas Latin is much more musical with the vocals. Latin
or pop are often thought as a genre for dancing and rock is not a genre
many people dance to. Thinking about how each of these genres are so
vastly different we are going to look at 5 characteristics that we feel
would be different across the genres.

The characteristics that we determined would be best to study were the
duration, loudness, speechiness, energy, and danceability. We will look
at each of these along with popularity, first to determine if there is a
unique characteristic for each genre and then if there is a relationship
between each of these characteristics and their overall popularity. We
also look at the popularity of each genre to help us determine if a
particular characteristic about the music tends to make the song more
popular.

We should begin with an explanation of our variables. Duration is the
measure of the length of the song and is reported in milliseconds.
Danceability is a value between 0.0 and 1.0 where 0.0 is the least
danceable and 1.0 is the most danceable. The danceability is determined
by an algorithm that looks at the beat strength, tempo, rhythm
stability, and overall regularity. Energy is a value between 0.0 and 1.0
that represents the intensity and activity. Energetic tracks are often
fast and noisy. The loudness is measured in decibels (dB) and is the
average of the decibels across the entire track. Values will typically
range between -60 and 0 dB. Speechiness is the measure of the spoken
word present in a song. The closer the value is to 1 the more
speech-like the track. Songs above 0.66 are likely entirely spoken
words. (Mock, 2020)

## Data Summary

We will look at the interesting variables mentioned above for each of
the genre to attempt to determine a defining characteristic or two about
each genre. Let’s first look at a nice stacked boxplot for each of the
variables that we are interested in exploring along with a boxplot of
the popularity of each genre. These might give us a visual idea of which
variables are key characteristics for each genre.

### Visual Exploration of Data

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

As we inspect the boxplot of duration for each genre we see that the
duration of the tracks we see that Rock and R\&B have the longest
tracks. EDM seems to have the shortest duration. It is important though
to note that the differences between the genres is pretty small so there
is likely very little difference statistically. It is interesting to
note that the data appears to be approximately bell shaped with very
little skewing due to outliers.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

When inspecting the average loudness of tracks for each genre we
discover a bit more variation than we saw with the duration. We note
here that EDM appears to be the loudest with R\&B the least loud. There
are low outliers for each genre, meaning that each genre does have a few
songs that are relatively quiet. Latin and R\&B are the two genres with
the quietest tracks.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

After a quick look at the boxplot for the danceability of each genre it
is clear that rock is the least danceable. Latin is fairly danceable and
surprisingly so is rap. We see that there are low outliers for each
genre and that rock has a few high outliers as well. This shows us that
each genre has a few songs that score poorly on the danceability rating.
Also that rock does have a few songs that are fairly danceable even
though as a genre rock appears to be the least danceable.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

The boxplot of energy for each of each genre doesn’t show us anything
too surprising. There are low outliers for all of the genres, which lets
us know that every genre has a few songs that are low energy. Just
knowing what our genres are it should be expected that EDM would be high
energy and R\&B would be low energy. Also not surprising rock appears to
be a bit higher in energy than all but EDM.Interestingly we can see that
R\&B is the least skewed due to it’s outliers.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

When it comes to thinking about speechiness one would of course guess
that rap would be the speechiest. The boxplot clearly depicts and
significant difference in the speechiness between the genres with rap
having a much higher speechiness rating than the other genres. It is
also clear from the boxplot that every genre actually has a few high
outliers meaning every genre does have a few songs that might feel more
like what we often think of as rap. Also since we see that rap even has
high outliers it shows us that while we do commonly think of rap as a
very speechy genre of music quite a few of the tracks are not as high on
the speechiness scale as you would expect. Though this does make sense
because every track has to have some good muscial qualities to it.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

As we conclude our graphical comparisons we wanted to take a look at the
popularity of tracks based on genre. It is pretty clear from the boxplot
that EDM is the least popular with pop being the most popular genre. We
are able to see that mos tof the genres have a fairly bell shaped
distribution that might tend toward a uniform distribution. There are
always some tracks with low popularity regardless of the genre and some
tracks that are highly popular. It is interesting to note while looking
at this boxplot that while EDM has the lowest median it actually rock
that has the smallest maximum value for track popularity.

Now that we have taken a look at the these boxplots we can would guess
that there would be a statistical difference in the average
danceability, energy, and speechiness based on genres. While we expect
that the duration and loudness of each genre would statistically be
roughly the same even though we can pick out a few that appear to be on
the upper or lower end of the spectrum it is not a huge difference.

### Summary Statistics

We will be performing ANOVA tests to determine if the genres have the
same average value for each of the variables that we are interested in.
The ANOvA test looks at the means whereas the boxplots summarize the
data by using the five number summary which showcases the minimum, first
quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of our data. The five
number summary values are more likely to be skewed by outliers as
compared to the mean. In the appendix you will find a table with the
mean values for each genre for each of the variables we studied. When
looking through the means for each characteristic it can be noted that
there is at least one genre that appears to be different than the rest.

From looking at the means we can see a few characteristics that appear
to make each genre stand apart. A summary of these differences can be
useful in coming to a hypthesis of what traits make each genre unique.
Also by looking at the genres popularity we may find a few clues as to
which traits could give us an indication of the popularity of the track.

EDM tends to be loud with high energy. EDM is the least popular genre
that we studied. R\&B tends to have longer tracks and is quiet compared
to other genres R\&B also is low on energy and on the longer end for
duration. R\&B is the second least popular genre in our study. Rock is
the third least popular genre in our study, but it is only slightly more
popular than R\&B. Rock often is quiet compared to the other genres, but
has a notably longer track length.

Rap comes next in popularity rankings, it is the fourth least popular,
making it the third most popular. Rap typically is very speechy and has
a high danceability score. Latin typically is shorter than other genres
and has a high danceability rating. Latin is the second most popular
genre. The most popular genre is pop, though it only beats out Latin by
a small margin. Pop tracks tend to be on the shorter end for track
length and has very little speechiness.

From this summary we can see that Latin and pop music share a few traits
and R\&B and rock share similar traits. We also notice that each of
those pairs have similar popularity rankings. This would lead us to
hypothesis that there are certain characteristics that might influence
the popularity of the track.

## Results

We ran a few different tests on our data to determine if there is a
difference in our genres based on the 5 track characteristics we
selected, then to determine if any of those characteristics had an
impact on the overall popularity of the track.

First an ANOVA test was performed to determine if there is a statistical
difference between the genres when looking at each of the track trait
variables. We performed an ANOVA test on each of the characteristic. The
results from the ANOVA test can be found in the appendix. Interestingly
even though we guessed that there may not be a statistical difference
with the duration and the loudness of tracks between the genres we found
in all of the overall F-tests that we should reject the null hypothesis
that the mean speechiness, energy, danceability, loudness, duration, and
popularity are the same. This means we should conclude that there is
evidence to support that there is a difference with all of these
characteristics across each genre. Since we found that there is a
difference naturally we should investigate to see which genres are the
same and which are different. To make this comparison we have used the
Tukey test to determine which genres are different that the others.

The Tukey test gave us some interesting results and some results that we
kind of expected from our graphical analysis of the data. When looking
at the speechiness of the genres we found that each genre is
statistically different when it comes to the level of speechiness in the
tracks. This is not terribly surprising from looking at the boxplots.
When we looked at each of the other track characteristics we found at
least a pair of genres that were similar.

We were able to determine that pop and latin are similar in energy,
loudness, and duration. We also found that rap and latin have similar
danceability ratings as well as being similar in duration. Seeing as pop
and latin were similar in duration and latin and rap are similar in
duration it was not surprising when it was found that rap and pop also
have tracks of similar length. When looking at the popularity of genres
we found that pop and latin are similar and that rock and rap are
similar. Though the strength of the similirites between rock and rap for
popularity ratings is not near as strong as the similarity between pop
and latin.

After analyzing the differences between the genres with the ANOVA test
we find that pop and latin are very similar in characteristics and also
have very similar popularity ratings. This leads us further to guess
that there will be a relationship between the track characteristics and
the popularity rating.

### Testing for linear relationships between track characteristics and popularity.

As we perform tests to determine if there are linear relationships
between the track characteristics and the popularity of the track we
also looked at the scatterplots. For many of the scatterplots we were
able to see fairly clearly that there would not be a linear relationship
between the characteristics and the popularity.

#### Danceability

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

From the scatterplot, there appears to be no significant relationship
between danceability and track popularity. When we performed a linear
regression test we found that both the correlation coefficent and the
coefficient of determination are both close to zero. Thus,the variation
observed in track popularity is not explained by danceability.

#### Energy

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

From the scatterplot, there appears to be slightly negative relationship
between track popularity and energy. When we performed a linear
regression test we found that both the correlation coefficent and the
coefficient of determination are both close to zero. Thus, but variation
in track popularity is not explained by energy.

#### Speechiness

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

From the scatterplot, it appears that there is no significant
relationship between track popularity and speechiness. When we performed
a linear regression test we found that both the correlation coefficent
and the coefficient of determination are both close to zero. Therefore,
we can say that any variation in track popularity cannot be explained by
speechiness.

#### Duration

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

This scatterplot shows that there may be a negative relationship between
duration of song and track popularity. When we performed a linear
regression test we found that both the correlation coefficent and the
coefficient of determination are both close to zero. Yet again, we can
say that any variation in track popularity cannot be explained by
duration.

#### Loudness

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

There appears to be no significant relationship between track popularity
and loudness. When we performed a linear regression test we found that
both the correlation coefficent and the coefficient of determination are
both close to zero. So, most of variation is not explained by the
loudness which suggests that there might other variables at play.

## Conclusions

From our study we are able to say that while there are a few defining
characteristics for each genre those characteristics do not predict the
popularity of the track. It was interesting though to note the unique
characteristics that made each genre have it’s own appeal. Ultimately it
is not terribly surprising that there is not one characteristic that
will make a song more popular. With the wide range of people who listen
to music there should be a wide range of traits that are desirable and
will result in a popular song.

If we had time to further our study we would like to further compare the
genres that we found were most similar to determine what characteristics
are the same and what characteristics are different. In that comparison
we would like to include data on other characteristics that we did not
include here.

Another thing that we would be interesting in studying given more time
is looking at other genres as well as including a few subgenres. We
recognize that the genres that we studied are not all encompassing and
there are other genres that would be interesting to collect data on.

The final additional analysis that we would add would be to determine if
there is a relationship between the characteristics that are similar
between genres. For example we found that energy and loudness were
similar for pop and latin which leads us to question whether there would
be a relationship betwen the energy and the loudness of the track.

Ultimately while we can pick apart the different genres by looking at
various characteristics of the tracks music is not something that picks
us apart as people; music brings us together. Whether you like rap,
enjoy some good R\&B, or get down with some rock, music is what brings
people from every walk of life together. So don’t over think it just go
pull up spotify and relax to your favorite tunes.
